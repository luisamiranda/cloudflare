Here are the reponses to your questions about the designs and the code.

***HTML & CSS Questions***

Which design details are difficult to implement?<br>
  * There wasn't any particularly difficult one, but I was unable to implement the highlighting of links and table rows or the email and password validation without JavaScript. In general, ensuring cross-browser compatibility is always difficult.<br>
<br>
Which design details are impossible to implement?
 * Nothing is impossoble if you believe in yourself :)<br>
<br>
As regards to the designs themselves:<br>
  Do they provide you with enough information to facilitate implementation?
    * The designs could definitely use more information from the designer, such as hex codes for colors and specific typefaces. The designs don't specify what should happen when the viewport/device size goes below 640px. It may never be necessary, but usually, I would implement a small size design that stacks components and/or drops some superfluous ones, but there was no mention of it, so I skipped it for now. The design also does not indicate how the table should look at 200px wide, so I gave it an overflow scroll, but I don't think it's very usable.<br>
<br>
  How would you change them? How might you seek confirmation or feedback?
    * In a non-challenge setting, I would send this prototype to the designer with specific questions about colors, typefaces, scrolling, and expected small screen use. <br>
<br>
  Are they good designs? That is, in your opinion, do they contain design errors?<br> 
  If they were to be implemented as is, would they enhance or hinder the user experience?
    * Aside from the lack of planning for smaller devices and table scrolling mentioned in the previous questions, I think they are nice, simple and legible designs.<br>
<br>
What browser-specific issues arise from the designs?
  * The decision to maintain compatibility with IE9 means that flexbox isn't fully supported. <br>
<br>
What compromises or changes would you make to facilitate cross-browser implementation?
  * The decision to maintain compatibility with IE9 means that flexbox isn't fully supported. <br>
